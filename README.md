# Ground States of Nonlinear Schrödinger Equation on the Tadpole Graph with a Repulsive Delta-Vertex Condition

This repository contains the Jupyter notebook used to perform the numerical computations and generate the figures presented in Section 5 of the article _Ground States of Nonlinear Schrödinger Equation on the Tadpole Graph with a Repulsive Delta-Vertex Condition_ by Romain Duboscq, Elio Durand-Simonnet and Stefan Le Coz.

## Grafidi library

This notebook uses the Grafidi library in order to perform computations on metric graphs. You can have access to the Grafidi library here: https://plmlab.math.cnrs.fr/cbesse/grafidi. Put the Grafidi.py file in the active directory.

## Details of the notebook
- The first chunk provides all libraries necessary for the code, including the Grafidi library.
- The second chunk
- The third chunk
- The fourth chunk
- The fifth and the sixth chunk
