# Ground States of Nonlinear Schrödinger Equation on the Tadpole Graph with a Repulsive Delta-Vertex Condition

This repository contains the Jupyter notebook used to perform the numerical computations and generate the figures presented in Section 5 of the article: "Ground States of Nonlinear Schrödinger Equation on the Tadpole Graph with a Repulsive Delta-Vertex Condition" by Romain Duboscq, Elio Durand-Simonnet and Stefan Le Coz.

## Grafidi library

This code uses the Grafidi library in order to perform computations on metric graphs. You can have access to the Grafidi library here:
